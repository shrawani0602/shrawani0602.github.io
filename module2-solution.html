                <h2>COFFEE</h2>
                <p>
                    Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
                    Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, 
                    depending on the desired flavor.
                    Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.

                <h2>TEA</h2>
                <p>
                    Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the
                   Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to East Asia.
                   After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.
                   There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, 
                   and astringent flavour,while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.
                   Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its caffeine content.
